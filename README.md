<h1>âœ… Currently Deployed for Testing</h1>

<h2>ðŸ”§ Testing Note</h2>
<h3>This is for reference only:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the <code>.html</code> extension from links. This works properly when the site is live on GitHub Pages.</li>
  <li>However, keep the <code>.html</code> extension when testing locally, because links wonâ€™t work without it.</li>
  <li>Before deploying, make sure to remove the <code>.html</code> extension again for the live version.</li>
</ul>
