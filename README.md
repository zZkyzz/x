âœ… Currently Deployed for Testing

ðŸ”§ Testing Note
This is for reference only:

â€¢ Remove the .html extension from links. This works properly when the site is live on GitHub Pages.
â€¢ However, keep the .html extension when testing locally, because links wonâ€™t work without it.
â€¢ Before deploying, make sure to remove the .html extension again for the live version.
